Additionally, many libraries offer online resources such as databases and e-books that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. Having a library card also allows students to take advantage of other library services such as interlibrary loan, which can help them access materials that are not available at their own library. Overall, getting a library card is a great way for college students to expand their knowledge and improve their academic performance."
